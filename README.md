# MortenKrebs.github.io

This repository is a simple academic personal website (GitHub Pages).

## What I added ✅
- `index.html` — single-page academic site with sections: About, Research, Publications, CV, Contact
- `assets/css/style.css` — simple, responsive stylesheet

## How to customize (quick)
1. Edit `index.html` to replace the placeholder name, bio, publications, and links.
2. Add your `cv.pdf` to the repository root if you want the "Download CV" button to work.
3. Commit & push to `main` — the site is served automatically at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.

## Notes
- This is a single static page (no build step). If you prefer a Jekyll site instead, tell me and I will convert it.
- To change colors or typography, edit `assets/css/style.css`.

Enjoy — update the placeholders and your site will be live on GitHub Pages.
